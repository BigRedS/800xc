# Installation Notes

----

### Uniflow Pre-cleaner (NU3704)

* Have a second person on hand to help -- their job is to have clean hands. Once you start installing the pre-cleaner, your hands are very messy.

##### Tools required

* 8mm hex bolt socket wrench
* 27 torx wrench
* 5mm hex head socket wrench
* Loctite 262 thread-locker
* Hand cleaner
* Personal virtues: aggression and patience

##### Steps

1. Remove seat.
2. Remove battery strap.
3. Remove four 8mm hex bolts holding ABS cover.
4. Remove two 5mm hex socket head bolts holding ABS cover and plastic trim.
5. Remove one 27 torx bolt holding ABS cover.
6. Remove ABS cover.
7. Remove one 8mm hex bolt holding air intake snorkel.
8. Remove air intake snorkel.
9. Remove air intake boot.
10. Remove fuel tank plastic trim (one each side).
11. Install pre-cleaner. **Align the bottom of the flange first, then work the top.**
12. Double-check that the pre-cleaner flange is properly sealed on the airbox.
13. Re-install all parts in reverse.
  * Use Loctite 262 thread-locker on the torx bolt and the 8mm bolt previously holding the snorkel.

### MIVV Oval Carbon Fibre exhaust (T.011.LEC)

##### Tools required

* 6mm hex socket head wrench
* 12mm hex bolt spanner
* 12mm hex bolt socket wrench
* 10mm hex bolt socket wrench
* Nose pliers
* Drill and bits if removing the DB killer
* WD-40

##### Steps

1. Remove the mounting bolt for the factory exhaust (12mm).
2. Loosen the exhaust clamp where it meets the exhaust headers (10mm).
3. Remove the factory exhaust system, keeping the nut from the mounting bolt.
4. Attach the rubber guard to the MIVV clamp. Soapy water helps here.
5. Install the MIVV link pipe and muffler, placing the mounting bolt through the clamp. Reuse the nut from the original mount since it is a 12mm head and the MIVV nut is 13mm which sucks. They are the same thread.
6. Be sure to align the link pipe and muffler so that it is not against the frame and tighten the mounting bolt.
7. Tighten the clamp where the link pipe meets the headers.
8. Install the rubber cover on the MIVV spring. Use WD-40 to slide it on easily.
9. Install the spring from the link pipe to the muffler using nose pliers.
10. The DB killer is held by a pop-rivet. First drill through with a 4mm drill bit, then drill again using a 4.5mm drill bit. The rivet should come loose and the DB killer is easily pulled out.
11. Place the small rubber grommet in the access hole to the DB killer.

##### Notes

* The muffler is not much louder without the DB killer in.
* The muffler moves around somewhat -- it is not a static mount.
* The build quality of the link pipe and muffler is excellent.
* The muffler is *much* lighter than the factory muffler.
* Carbon fibre seems a little weak and may not survive a fall. Consider titanium.
* The fitting is a bit poor, in that the muffler and link pipe are too close to the frame.
* Once the DB killer is removed, there is no going back (easily).
* The bike could benefit from an appropriate ECU mapping for the open muffler.
